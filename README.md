# Interview Scheduler

## Summary

Using the latest tools and techniques, I created a React application that allows users to book and cancel interviews! This app is loaded on a single page. Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database. Jest tests, as well as Cypress tests were used in the development of this project.


#Capabilities

This app is able to:

- View each day and the spots remaining for each day with the interactive UI:
!["View Days!"]
- View all the appointments available for a given day :
!["View Appointments!"]
- Add and create an interview with your name and Instructor of choice:
!["Add and Create!"]
- Edit and save previously added interviews :
!["Edit!"]
- Delete Interview with a confirmation :
!["Delete!"]
